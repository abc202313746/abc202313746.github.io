Hello, I'm SookYoung In. I focus on Frontend development with React and TypeScript, aiming to "build fast while keeping code readable and experiences delightful."

Key experiences
- Jeonju Cultural Tourism DB Design: Requirements ‚Üí ERD ‚Üí 3NF normalization ‚Üí Oracle SQL schema and data build
- Operating Systems core topics: processes/threads, scheduling, and synchronization with hands-on C examples and analysis
- Stack-based calculator: convert infix to postfix and evaluate using a custom stack implementation (C/C++)

What I value when working
- Usability (UX) & accessibility: clear interaction, information structure, and both dark/light modes
- Collaboration & documentation: tidy commits, issue-scoped tasks, and lightweight docs for shareable outputs
- CI/CD: automated static site build/deploy with GitHub Actions

Now learning more about Next.js/TypeScript, testing (Vitest/Jest), design systems (Storybook), SEO and performance. See my resume and projects below for more details.
