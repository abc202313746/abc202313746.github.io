Hello, I'm SookYoung In (인숙영), a Computer Science student at Jeonbuk National University. I'm currently a junior at Jeonbuk National University's School of Computer & Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Frontend development with React and TypeScript.

At Jeonbuk National University, I've completed coursework in Database Design, Operating Systems, and Data Structures, building practical skills through hands-on projects:

Key experiences at Jeonbuk National University:
- Jeonju Cultural Tourism DB Design: Requirements analysis → ERD → 3NF normalization → Oracle SQL implementation
- Operating Systems implementation: File system and memory management in xv6 educational OS
- Data Structures project: Stack-based calculator with infix to postfix conversion (C/C++)

What I value in development:
- User Experience: Creating intuitive interfaces with accessibility in mind
- Code Quality: Clean, maintainable code with proper documentation
- Continuous Learning: Staying updated with modern web technologies

Currently expanding my knowledge in Next.js, TypeScript, testing frameworks, and performance optimization while pursuing my degree at Jeonbuk National University.
