<div class="justify-text">
A low-level programming project implementing a custom memory allocator in C, demonstrating deep understanding of memory management, pointer manipulation, and system-level programming. This project showcases efficient memory allocation strategies and optimization techniques for improved performance.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Memory Management
- **Custom malloc()**: Dynamic memory allocation implementation
- **Custom free()**: Memory deallocation and defragmentation
- **Memory Pool**: Efficient memory block management

### âš¡ Performance Optimization
- **First-Fit Algorithm**: Fast memory allocation
- **Memory Alignment**: Cache efficiency improvement
- **Fragmentation Prevention**: Memory space optimization

### ðŸ”§ System-Level Features
- **Pointer Operations**: Direct memory address manipulation
- **Bit Operations**: Efficient metadata management
- **System Calls**: Direct interface with OS

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C (C99 Standard)
- **Compilers**: GCC, Clang
- **Debugging**: GDB, Valgrind
- **Platform**: Linux, Unix-like systems

## Core Algorithms

### Memory Block Structure
```c
typedef struct block {
    size_t size;
    int free;
    struct block *next;
} block_t;
```

### Allocation Strategy
- **First-Fit**: Use first suitable block
- **Coalescing**: Merge adjacent free blocks
- **Splitting**: Divide large blocks to required size

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained deep understanding of low-level memory management principles in C and hands-on experience implementing core system programming concepts.
