As part of algorithm studies at Jeonbuk National University, SookYoung In (인숙영) engaged in **comprehensive algorithm problem solving and analysis**. This ongoing project involves studying various algorithmic paradigms and implementing efficient solutions.

Key areas of focus include:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Solved complex optimization problems using memoization and tabulation techniques.
2. **Graph Algorithms**: Implemented BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, and minimum spanning tree algorithms.
3. **Sorting and Searching**: Analyzed time complexity of various sorting algorithms and implemented binary search variations.
4. **Competitive Programming**: Participated in online contests to improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.

Through this algorithmic journey, I developed strong analytical thinking skills and learned to optimize code for both time and space complexity, essential skills for technical interviews and software development.
