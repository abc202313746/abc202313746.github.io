As part of mobile development exploration, SookYoung In (인숙영) developed **cross-platform mobile applications using React Native**. This project focused on creating native mobile experiences while leveraging web development skills.

Key development aspects included:
1. **Cross-Platform Development**: Built applications that run seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms.
2. **Native Components**: Integrated native device features like camera, GPS, and push notifications.
3. **State Management**: Implemented Redux for complex state management across mobile app components.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Applied mobile-specific optimization techniques for smooth user experience.

This mobile development experience expanded my understanding of cross-platform development challenges and solutions, providing valuable skills for modern app development in the mobile-first world.
