For advanced web development studies, SookYoung In (인숙영) worked on **full-stack web application development** projects that integrate frontend and backend technologies. This project demonstrates comprehensive understanding of modern web development stack.

The development stack included:
1. **Backend Development**: Built RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js with proper error handling and validation.
2. **Database Integration**: Designed and implemented database schemas with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
3. **Authentication & Security**: Implemented user authentication, authorization, and security best practices.
4. **Frontend Integration**: Connected React frontend with backend APIs using modern state management solutions.

This full-stack development experience provided valuable insights into the complete web development lifecycle, from database design to user interface implementation, preparing for real-world software development challenges.
