For my personal portfolio project, SookYoung In (인숙영) developed a **modern React-based portfolio website** using TypeScript and responsive design principles. This project focused on creating an intuitive user interface that showcases projects and skills effectively.

The development process included:
1. **Component Architecture**: Built reusable React components with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
2. **Responsive Design**: Implemented mobile-first design approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal viewing across devices.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Applied code splitting, lazy loading, and image optimization techniques to improve loading times.
4. **User Experience**: Designed intuitive navigation, smooth animations, and accessible interfaces following WCAG guidelines.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in modern frontend development practices, including component-based architecture, state management, and performance optimization techniques essential for creating professional web applications.
