For data science exploration, SookYoung In (인숙영) worked on **machine learning and data analysis projects** using Python and popular ML libraries. This project involved applying various algorithms to real-world datasets.

The project workflow included:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared datasets using pandas and numpy for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selected and transformed features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Implemented various algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Used cross-validation and metrics to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

This machine learning experience provided insights into data-driven decision making and predictive modeling, valuable skills for modern software development and business intelligence applications.
